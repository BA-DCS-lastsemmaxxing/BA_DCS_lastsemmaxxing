Review of International 
Carbon Pricing Policy
(1) Background
The carbon tax in Singapore is currently at $25 per tonne, adjusted from $5 per tonne in 2024, with a view to reaching S$50-80 per tonne by 
2030. A transition framework has been introduced to provide allowances to emissions-intensive & trade-exposed sectors to help manage the 
near-term impact on Singapore’s business competitiveness. To ensure that our carbon tax policy remains relevant while balancing against our 
economic competitiveness, Singapore will need to understand the evolving carbon pricing policy developments in key competitor 
jurisdictions.
(2) Deliverables/ Expectations
As our intern, you will be required to:
a) Conduct a desktop review to assess the impact of carbon tax on the cost competitiveness of Singapore companies and  evaluate policy 
grounds for carbon pricing.
b) Develop a repository to capture the carbon pricing policy, carbon pricing levels, and free allocation quantities in key jurisdictions.
c) Provide a preliminary assessment and recommendation on the carbon pricing trajectory for 2030 and beyond, factoring in cost 
competitiveness with other jurisdictions.
d) Perform a desktop review on the appropriateness of benchmarking methodologies implemented for other sectors outside of the refineries 
and crackers sectors.
(3) Other experiences available to you as part of the internship:

Drug Repurposing (1)  Background
The traditional drug discovery approach is often long, costly, and fraught with uncertainty and a high failure rate. Over the last few years, there 
have been increased efforts in repurposing and repositioning of existing drugs or molecules to improve the pace of discovery. 
Drug repurposing is an alternative strategy that companies have adopted to reduce the time and costs whereby new uses are identified for 
drugs already approved or under investigation. This is further accelerated with AI and machine learning that allow researchers to sift through 
vast amounts of data, identify hidden patterns, and generate insights needed for repurposing.

20 Healthcare Innovative Healthcare 
Financing & Market Access for 
NCDs
(1) Background
Global health financing for non-communicable diseases (NCDs) is limited, despite the growing burden on Low and Middle Income Countries 
(LMICs). Precision medicine and other emerging technologies have the potential to help treat these conditions, but they require adequate 
financing. Global development assistance for health (DAH) funding programs have been mainly concentrated on infectious diseases, 
HIV/AIDs, malaria/TB, and newborn and child health. Innovative financing mechanisms focused on NCDs are currently lacking, and there are 
no innovative financing programmes for precision medicine.
Even in higher income countries like the US and Singapore, increasing health spending relative to GDP has led governments to re-evaluate 
their fiscal space for novel health innovations, given the high cost and long investment period to validate experimental therapies. Closer to 
home, Singapore needs to rethink our healthcare financing policies to support and embrace technological advances in medical science, such 
as precision medicine, gene editing, and artificial intelligence, while thoroughly examining the clinical evidence and evaluating the cost of 
these interventions.
How can Singapore facilitate market access in the region for life science interventions through innovative healthcare financing models?
(2) Deliverables/ Expectations
As our intern, you will help us to: 
a) Understand the global and regional landscape for innovative healthcare financing models, including through engaging pharma/MedTech 
companies, think tanks, financial institutions, non-profits (e.g. philanthropic capital/foundations) and fintech firms.
b) Ascertain if anchoring innovative healthcare financing activities in Singapore can generate economic value for healthcare firms, including 
through growing regional market access teams.

X-as-a-Service Business 
Model in Building Automation 
and Industrial Automation 
Sectors
(1) Background
Smart buildings that are capable of harnessing power from workouts at onsite gyms and lighthouse factories equipped with robotics and 
machine learning algorithms are no longer just scenes from sci-fi movies.
 
This is made possible in the digital era by Industrial Automation (IA) and Building Automation (BA) companies who are trying to incorporate 
"digital threads" into hardware and thereby expand their business model beyond manufacturing into X-as-a-Service (e.g. Software-as-a-
Service, Cooling-as-a-Service). Leading IA and BA companies do so by building competencies based on existing software platforms such as 
Johnson Controls' OpenBlue and Rockwell Automation's FactoryTalk Innovation Suite. This study will explore the relevance and value of the X-
as-a-Service model and its implications on the IA and BA sectors. 
 
(2) Deliverables/ Expectations
Your deliverables are:
a) Map out the attributes of X-as-a Service business model in Industrial Automation and building automation sectors.
b) Identify the current industry uptake for X-as-a-Service offerings, gaps and opportunities in the shift towards such offerings
c) Develop ideas on how Singapore can pre-position ourselves to capture a larger share of activities arising from the X-as-a-Service business 
model, such as through capability building and ecosystem partnerships
 
(3) Other experiences available to you as part of the internship:
During your internship, you will have opportunities to engage with leading building automation and industrial automation companies, and be
