'''
This function is used after the text has been extracted from the raw PDFs, and then it extracts a hybrid sample made out of the Intro, Middle and Conclusion, but contain no more than 16k tokens. This seeks to improve the efficiency of the model and save cost, since we pass in a sample that retains as much information as possible from the original text, but is not too large to be processed by the model.
